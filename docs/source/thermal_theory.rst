Thermal theory and Modeling.
=============================


Theory based on heat equation: `wiki <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_equation>`_

All procces heat spreading is described by the formula:

.. math:: du/dt =\alpha(d^2u/dx^2 + d^2u/dy^2+ d^2u/dz^2)


Calculations using this formula are very complex and time consuming.

This why needs to simplify calculations. For this we can create simple thermal  model of house.
